# What is Fluss?

Fluss is a streaming storage built for real-time analytics which can serve as the real-time data layer for Lakehouse architectures.

It bridges the gap between **streaming data** and the data **Lakehouse** by enabling low-latency, high-throughput data ingestion and processing while seamlessly integrating with popular compute engines like **Apache Flink**, while **Apache Spark**, and **StarRocks** are coming soon.

Fluss supports `streaming reads` and `writes` with sub-second latency and stores data in a columnar format, enhancing query performance and reducing storage costs. 
It offers flexible table types, including append-only **Log Tables** and updatable **PrimaryKey Tables**, to accommodate diverse real-time analytics and processing needs.

With built-in replication for fault tolerance, horizontal scalability, and advanced features like high-QPS lookup joins and bulk read/write operations, Fluss is ideal for powering **real-time analytics**, **AI/ML pipelines**, and **streaming data warehouses**. 

**Fluss (German: river, pronounced `/flus/`)** enables streaming data continuously converging, distributing and flowing into lakes, like a river ðŸŒŠ
