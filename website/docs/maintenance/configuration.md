# Configuration

All configuration can be set in Fluss configuration file `conf/server.yaml`

The configuration is parsed and evaluated when the Fluss processes are started. 
Changes to the configuration file require restarting the relevant processes.

Users can organize config in format `key: value`, such as:

```yaml title="conf/server.yaml"
default.bucket.number: 8
default.replication.factor: 3
remote.data.dir: /home/fluss/data
remote.fs.write-buffer-size: 10mb
auto-partition.check.interval: 5min
```


## Server Configuration

Server configuration refers to a set of configurations used to specify the running parameters of a server. 
These settings can only be configured at the time of cluster startup and do not support dynamic modification
during the Fluss cluster working.

| zookeeper.client.tolerate-suspended-connections | Boolean | false   | Defines whether a suspended ZooKeeper connection will be treated as an error that causes the leader information to be invalidated or not. In case you set this option to %s, Fluss will wait until a ZooKeeper connection is marked as lost before it revokes the leadership of components. This has the effect that Fluss is more resilient against temporary connection instabilities at the cost of running more likely into timing issues with ZooKeeper.                                                                 |
| zookeeper.client.ensemble-tracker               | Boolean | true    | Defines whether Curator should enable ensemble tracker. This can be useful in certain scenarios in which CuratorFramework is accessing to ZK clusters via load balancer or Virtual IPs. Default Curator EnsembleTracking logic watches CuratorEventType.GET_CONFIG events and changes ZooKeeper connection string. It is not desired behaviour when ZooKeeper is running under the Virtual IPs. Under certain configurations EnsembleTracking can lead to setting of ZooKeeper connection string with unresolvable hostnames. |

Retention and cleaning is always done a file at a time so a larger segment size means fewer files but less granular control over retention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| log.index.file-size                            | MemorySize | 10m            | This configuration controls the size of the index that maps offsets to file positions. We preallocate this index file and shrink it only after log rolls. You generally should not need to change this setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| log.index.interval-size                        | MemorySize | 4k             | This setting controls how frequently fluss adds an index entry to its offset index. The default setting ensures that we index a message roughly every 4096 bytes. More indexing allows reads to jump closer to the exact position in the log but makes the index larger.

The total number of fetchers on each tablet server is bound by this parameter multiplied by the number of tablet servers in the cluster. Increasing this value can increase the degree of I/O parallelism in the follower and leader tablet server at the cost of higher CPU and memory utilization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Records are fetched in batches for log scanner or follower, for one request batch, and if the first record batch in the first non-empty bucket of the fetch is larger than this value, the record batch will still be returned to ensure that the fetch can make progress. As such, this is not a absolute maximum. Note that the fetcher performs multiple fetches in parallel.                                                                                                                                                    |

| log.replica.min-in-sync-replicas-number        | Integer    | 1              | When a producer set acks to all (-1), this configuration specifies the minimum number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for the write to be considered successful. If this minimum cannot be met, then the producer will raise an exception(NotEnoughReplicas). when used together, this config and 'acks' allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a table with a replication factor of 3. set this conf to 2, and produce with acks = -1. This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a majority of replicas don't receive a write. |

Without a rolling strategy, it may lead to uncontrolled disk space usage if configured with increased log levels!  There is no need to modify the RocksDB log level, unless for troubleshooting RocksDB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| kv.rocksdb.compaction.level.use-dynamic-size      | Boolean    | false                         | If true, RocksDB will pick target size of each level dynamically. From an empty DB, RocksDB would make last level the base level, which means merging L0 data into the last level, until it exceeds max_bytes_for_level_base. And then repeat this process for second last level and so on. The default value is 'false'.

| kv.rocksdb.compression.per.level                  | Enum       | LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,ZSTD,ZSTD | A comma-separated list of Compression Type. Different levels can have different compression policies. In many cases, lower levels use fast compression algorithms, while higher levels with more data use slower but more effective compression algorithms. The N th element in the List corresponds to the compression type of the level N-1 When 'kv.rocksdb.compaction.level.use-dynamic-size' is true, compression_per_level[0] still determines L0, but other elements are based on the base level and may not match the level seen in the info log. Note: If the List size is smaller than the level number, the undefined lower level uses the last Compression Type in the List. The optional values include NO, SNAPPY, LZ4, ZSTD. For more information about compression type, please refer to doc https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Compression. The default value is ‘LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,LZ4,ZSTD,ZSTD’, indicates there is lz4 compaction of level0 and level4, ZSTD compaction algorithm is used from level5 to level6. LZ4 is a lightweight compression algorithm so it usually strikes a good balance between space and CPU usage. ZSTD is more space save than LZ4, but it is more CPU-intensive. Different machines deploy compaction modes according to CPU and I/O resources. The default value is for the scenario that CPU resources are adequate. If you find the IO pressure of the system is not big when writing a lot of data, but CPU resources are inadequate, you can exchange I/O resources for CPU resources and change the compaction mode to 'NO,NO,NO,LZ4,LZ4,ZSTD,ZSTD'. |

### Config by Flink SQL

When you create a table in Fluss by Flink, you can specify the table configuration by Flink in with options, like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
) WITH (
  'bucket.num' = '2',
  'table.log.ttl' = '7 days',
  'table.auto-partition.enabled' = 'true',
  'table.auto-partition.time-unit' = 'DAY');
```

:::note
Currently, we don't support alter table configuration by Flink. This will be supported soon.

Normally this occurs only under load when rows arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the writer may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay, that is, rather than immediately sending out a row, the writer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get client.writer.batch-size worth of rows for a bucket it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this bucket we will delay for the specified time waiting for more records to show up. This setting defaults to 100ms |

No guarantee can be mode that the server has received the record in this case.<br/>acks=1: This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledge the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost.<br/>acks=-1 (all): This will mean the leader will wait for the full ser of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record.

### Config by Flink SQL

1. When you create a table in Fluss by Flink, you can specify the client configuration by Flink in with options, like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
) WITH (
  'bucket.num' = '2',
  'client.writer.acks ' = 'all');
```

2. Also, you can change the client configuration use [Flink SQL Hints](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/dev/table/sql/queries/hints/#dynamic-table-options) like:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_table /*+ OPTIONS('client.writer.acks' = '0') */
SELECT *
FROM my_source
```
