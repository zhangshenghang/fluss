# Amazon S3

[Amazon Simple Storage Service](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Amazon S3) is cloud object storage with industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

## Configurations setup

To enabled S3 as remote storage, there are some required configurations that must be added to Fluss' `server.yaml`:

```yaml
# The dir that used to be as the remote storage of Fluss
remote.data.dir: s3://<your-bucket>/path/to/remote/storage
# access key
s3.access-key: <your-access-key>
# secret key
s3.secret-key: <your-secret-key>
# region
s3.region: <your-s3-region>
```
